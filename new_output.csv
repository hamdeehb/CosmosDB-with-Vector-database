As the year draws to a close, I find myself reflecting on the incredible journey—both personally and professionally—that 2024 has been. Christmas reminds us of the joy of giving, the power of hope, and the importance of community. Similarly, Shaheedi Week inspires us to honor sacrifices, uphold courage, and strive for a purpose greater than ourselves. These values resonate deeply, both in life and in work. I am profoundly grateful for the opportunities this year has brought—the successes, the challenges, and the growth they’ve inspired. Collaborating with talented colleagues, learning from every interaction, and witnessing the resilience of teams in moments of change have been some of the most enriching experiences. On a personal note, this year has reinforced the importance of gratitude, empathy, and staying connected to one’s values. As we celebrate the joy of the season and honor the legacies of courage and sacrifice, I want to take a moment to thank everyone who has been a part of my journey Deepika Singh Macker, Sarabjit Anand, Paul Bari, Keith De Silva, Joseph Ng, Thomas Chapman, Arun Godiyal, Cheryl Ong, Nauman Bashir, Andy Donnelly, Sheeja M., Saurav Bhatia, Ajay Kaushal, Avish Joseph, @Dr Roland Yap, Yusuf Roopawalla, Mahesh Thiagarajan, Anne Veloo . Your support, guidance, and camaraderie have been invaluable. Here’s to closing this year on a note of gratitude and stepping into 2025 with purpose and positivity. Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas, a meaningful Shahidi Week, and a successful year ahead! #Gratitude #Reflection #FestiveSeason #ShaheediWeek

Because some of us are entering into 2025 wound-up too tight. Early in my career, I was privileged to be able to work with the late Sydney Brenner - nobel laureate in Medicine and Physiology. He had this pasted on the front door of his laboratory to greet visitors. Biomedical researchers have kits for everything, and many a young researcher came to his lab badly in need of advice. So start with this he seemed to say. It always had the desired effect - putting them in the right frame of mind for #creative thinking. Over my career, I've co-opted this (either on my office door or workstation) - one of his many little ""nuggets of wisdom"". And it still works (often gets a laugh and puts colleagues at ease)
